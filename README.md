# app_for_learning_english

### **Topic**: _Design of an application for learning a foreign language - English_  
**Subject**: _Basics of Web Design_

*Welcome to my first project, web application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project focuses on creating an interactive platform for learning the English language,
designed primarily for children aged 6-11 years old, as well as older kids interested in learning the basics of the english language.*

*The application offers an engaging learning experience where users can visualize English words and hear their pronunciation.
Words are organized into several main categories, making it easier for learners to navigate and focus on specific topics of interest.*

*As users progress and master the words within each category, a quiz feature automatically appears to assess their knowledge and reinforce learning. 
This interactive quiz adds an element of gamification, motivating users to continue their language learning journey.*

*In addition, the application leverages Firebase hosting, ensuring a access for users across various devices and locations.*
